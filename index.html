            <p>Irish rock band, The Cranberries, rose to fame in the 1990s with their debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It. Their sound is easily recongizable for lead singer Dolores O'Riordan's gritty vocals and their Irish folk and post-punk influence. The band became one of the most widely recognized acts of the '90s after landing four top 20 albums on Billboard 200's charts. Their song, "Zombie" has been used in signing competitons around the world thanks to its haunting melody and relatable lyrics. Whether someone was a teenager of the '90s or not, The Cranberries is the quintesential rock band.</p>
